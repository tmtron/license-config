# License Configuration

This project contains some configuration to make the [License Maven Plugin](http://code.mycila.com/license-maven-plugin/) compatible to the [IntelliJ Idea IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

It contains a custom [Header style definition](http://code.mycila.com/license-maven-plugin/#changing-header-style-definitions) which matches the format of the Idea XML headers. 
 
## Usage

You want to make sure that the Idea configuration exactly matches the _License Maven Plugin_ configuration. 

### Maven

#### Maven Configuration
Example configuration for the _License Maven Plugin_ in the (parent) pom of the project: 

```xml
<project>
    <properties>
        <owner.name>Martin Trummer</owner.name>
        <owner.email>martin.trummer@tmtron.com</owner.email>
    </properties>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.mycila</groupId>
                <artifactId>license-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <dependencies>
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>com.tmtron</groupId>
                        <artifactId>license-maven-plugin-config</artifactId>
                        <version>1.0.0</version>
                    </dependency>
                </dependencies>
    
                <configuration>
                    <header>com/mycila/maven/plugin/license/templates/APACHE-2.txt</header>
                    <properties>
                        <owner>${owner.name}</owner>
                        <email>${owner.email}</email>
                    </properties>
                    <excludes>
                        <exclude>**/README</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/LICENSE</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/NOTICE</exclude>
                        <exclude>src/test/resources/**</exclude>
                        <exclude>src/main/resources/**</exclude>
                    </excludes>
                    <mapping>
                        <java>SLASHSTAR_STYLE</java>
                        <xml>idea_xml_style</xml>
                    </mapping>
                    <headerDefinitions>
                        <headerDefinition>idea-xml-header.xml</headerDefinition>
                    </headerDefinitions>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>check</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
     </build>
</project>     
```

Notes:
 * the `license-maven-plugin` must define a dependency to `license-maven-plugin-config`, so that the [idea-xml-header.xml](src/main/resources/idea-xml-header.xml) file can be found from the classpath.
 * we must add a `headerDefinition` item, to read the `idea-xml-header.xml` file
 * finally we can use the `idea_xml_style` for the xml-mapping.
 * we also add an execution section, so that the license-check will be done during the maven [verify](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html) build phase  

#### Maven Execution
When you want to add missing file-headers to your project files, just run:

    mvn license:format
 
### Idea configuration
1. _File_ - _Settings_ - _Copyright_- _Copyright profiles_
   * Click the + button and add a new profile called `Apache2`
   * Add the copyright text - see section [Idea Copyright Text](#idea-copyright-text) below        
1. _File_ - _Settings_ - _Copyright_  
   _Default project copyright_: select `Apache2`  
    
#### Idea Copyright Text
Notes:
 * we use the copyright symbol, because the _License Maven Plugin_ also replaces (C) with the symbol automatically.
 * we use the `$today.year` variable in this template
 * this text must exactly match whath the _License Maven Plugin_ expects.

## Details

The configuration is required because the _License Maven Plugin_ and Idea use different formats for the copyright in XML headers.
* Idea uses `  ~ ` at the beginning of each line
* _License Maven Plugin_ uses blanks only
